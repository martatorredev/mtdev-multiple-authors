## 🧠 Description

**MTDev Multiple Authors Block** allows you to select and display multiple authors (co-authors) for any post, using a fully accessible block built with native WordPress features.

### ✨ Features
- Select additional co-authors for any post directly in the block editor.
- Display all authors (main + co-authors) on the frontend.
- 100% built with **WordPress core components** — no external frameworks.
- Follows **WCAG 2.1 AA** and **WordPress Accessibility Handbook** guidelines.
- Works in both the **Post Editor** and the **Site Editor (FSE)**.

---

## ♿ Accessibility

This block has been designed and tested with accessibility in mind:

- Semantic HTML (`<p>`, `<span>`, `<a>`).
- `role="group"` and `aria-label="Post authors"` for screen readers.
- Accessible form fields using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` inside the Inspector Controls.
- Keyboard-friendly navigation.
- Clear, translatable labels.

> ✅ Accessibility is not an afterthought — it's part of the core design.
